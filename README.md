## Description
This project is a small ___C++___ application using ___OpenGL___, ___GLEW___, and ___GLFW___ to render a simple triangle.  
It demonstrates the basic use of `vertex and fragment shaders`, `vertex buffers`, and `vertex attribute` bindings to handle GPU data processing.

## Update: Rectangle Rendering
The project has been updated, and now it includes the capability to render a rectangle.  
This enhancement is available in the `indexBuffer-rectangle` branch. The update involves the addition of indices and handling the data with an index buffer, further demonstrating more advanced OpenGL techniques.

## Features
- Rendering a simple triangle using OpenGL.
- Implementation of vertex and fragment shaders.
- Vertex buffer and vertex attribute binding for data handling.
